### What is the difference between the section tag and the div tag?
Answer: 

In HTML, both div and section are elements used for structuring and organizing content, but they serve different purposes.

(div) (Division Element):

The div element is a generic container that is used to group together and apply styles or scripts to a section of HTML content.
It does not carry any semantic meaning on its own. It is a block-level container that helps in structuring and styling the layout of a web page.
It is commonly used to group and separate content for styling purposes or to create distinct sections in a web page.
Example:

html
Copy code
(div)
    (p) This is some content inside a div.(/p)
(div)
(section) (Section Element):

The (section) element is used to define a thematic grouping of content within a document. It represents a section of content that is thematically related and can be treated as an independent unit.
Unlike (div), (section) carries some semantic meaning. It helps to convey the structure and meaning of the content.
It is often used to divide the content of a page into distinct sections, such as chapters, articles, or related groups of content.
Example:

html
Copy code
(ection>)
    (h2)Introduction(/h2)
    (p)This is the introduction section of the document.(/p)
(/section)
In summary, while both (div) and (section) can be used for grouping content, (div) is a generic container for layout and styling, whereas (section) is semantically meaningful and is used to represent a thematic grouping of content. Choosing between them depends on the specific purpose and structure of your HTML document.

### What is the span tag used for?
Answer:
The span tag in HTML is a generic inline container that is used to group and apply styles to inline elements. It doesn't have any specific semantic meaning on its own. Instead, it is often used with CSS to apply styling or JavaScript to manipulate the content within the span tag.

For example, you might use the span tag to apply a specific style to a portion of text, or to group inline elements together for styling purposes. Here's a simple example:

## Problems with github:

I was not getting updated data to github even though the linux terminal told me there were no updates left. So what I did some research and created a new repository. Then I got another error saying I dont had the rights when pushing. So I removed the remote repo from my computer and created a new one. I follwed all the steps on github.com for transferring an existing repository to github. Then I tried pushing without commiting and got another error. After a bit of research I realized I forgot to commit first. Now I have a new repository that works and updates github everytime I commit and push my new data. 

## Confusing tags:
figure tag: figure indents a picture and separates it form other things likee text,you can add an image, a figcaption, and a embed a link to the picture

the label tag: tricky thing to understand. But this tag basically just enables you to be able to click on a word and have form to be activated right next to it. A form tag is used to create an HTML form that allows users to input data and submit it to a server for processing. Forms are a crucial part of web development, enabling interactions like user authentication, data entry, and various other types of user input. For example on one of the projects there was a radio button next to a text. Without the label tag clicking on the text next to the radio button would not do anything. But once I implemented the label tag inside the input type radio, it enabled me to be able to click on the radio button even if I just clicked on the text next to it. That is the power of the label tag
